Synonymous app lists 17000+ words and their synonyms. 

This app was first developed as a browser app using JQuery mobile UI library, HTML5, CSS and Javascript.  
Only 100 words are added to the listview initially, and 10 words are added to the list on 
every scroll. 

Horizontal Swipe is  implemented using the swipe method of JQuery mobile.

The list view and the synonyms are implemented as one page, 
with one of them hidden at a time.

This app is then packaged using Appception IDE to both Android and iOS platforms.
