This repository houses the work produced in the project: ***Mobile App Performance Challenge: Native vs. HTML5 Hybrid Apps***. The contributors are: [Aristide](https://github.com/Aristide1o), [Madhok](https://github.com/madhok), [Prabhjot](https://github.com/singhprabhjot), [Rashmi](https://github.com/RashmiDR), and [Shama](https://github.com/shamahoque).We carried out the project in the context of the [CMU Silicon Valley software engineering](http://www.cmu.edu/silicon-valley/academics/software-engineering/) [practicum course](http://www.cmu.edu/silicon-valley/academics/courses/96710.html); the sponsor is [Appception inc](http://www.appception.com/).


##Goals
The project has two goals:

1. benchmarking performance of HTML5 UI operations and optimizations in mobile user agents.
2. comparison of appearance , behavior, and performance of Hybrid Apps (WebView, UIWebView) versus Native Apps (iOS, Android).

## Project components
The project has five major components, each covering a specific scope within the gols. The componets - and their scope - are:

- Android Native App: This is Synonymous, a thesaurus app built for comparison with a hybrid counterpart. It's documented in its specific [README file]().
- iOS Native App:
- Android & iOS iOS Hybrid App:
- Self-timing tests suite: 
- Chrome developer tools timeline test suite:
